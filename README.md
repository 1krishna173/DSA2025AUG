# DSA2025AUG
This repository documents my daily Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey starting August 2025.
My goal is to master problem-solving for competitive programming and interview preparation, targeting internships in 2026.


This table tracks all solved problems and algorithms in the **ARRAYS** folder.
